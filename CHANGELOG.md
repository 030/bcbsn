# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2019-05-12
### Added
- HTTP tests [@jorianvo](https://github.com/jorianvo).
- Multiple badges including devops.stackexchange batch about [bcbsn tag](https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bcbsn).
- New dockerhub repository [utrecht/bcbsn](https://cloud.docker.com/u/utrecht/repository/docker/utrecht/bcbsn) as it was
impossible to rename repositories on dockerhub.

### Changed
- Repository renamed to bcbsn as former name exceeded tag character limit on [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/).
- All references in README renamed due to repository name change.

### Removed
- Section about "changelog" vs "CHANGELOG".

## [0.3.0] - 2015-12-03
### Added
- RU translation from [@aishek](https://github.com/aishek).
- pt-BR translation from [@tallesl](https://github.com/tallesl).
- es-ES translation from [@ZeliosAriex](https://github.com/ZeliosAriex).

## [0.2.0] - 2015-10-06
### Changed
- Remove exclusionary mentions of "open source" since this project can
benefit both "open" and "closed" source projects equally.

## [0.1.0] - 2015-10-06
### Added
- Answer "Should you ever rewrite a change log?".

### Changed
- Improve argument against commit logs.
- Start following [SemVer](https://semver.org) properly.

## [0.0.8] - 2015-02-17
### Changed
- Update year to match in every README example.
- Reluctantly stop making fun of Brits only, since most of the world
  writes dates in a strange way.

### Fixed

## [0.0.7] - 2015-02-16
### Added
- Link, and make it obvious that date format is ISO 8601.

### Changed
- Clarified the section on "Is there a standard change log format?".

### Fixed
- Fix Markdown links to tag comparison URL with footnote-style links.

## [0.0.6] - 2014-12-12
### Added
- README section on "yanked" releases.

## [0.0.5] - 2014-08-09
### Added
- Markdown links to version tags on release headings.
- Unreleased section to gather unreleased changes and encourage note
keeping prior to releases.

## [0.0.4] - 2014-08-09
### Added
- Better explanation of the difference between the file ("CHANGELOG")
and its function "the change log".

### Changed
- Refer to a "change log" instead of a "CHANGELOG" throughout the site
to differentiate between the file and the purpose of the file â€” the
logging of changes.

### Removed
- Remove empty sections from CHANGELOG, they occupy too much space and
create too much noise in the file. People will have to assume that the
missing sections were intentionally left out because they contained no
notable changes.

### Added
- "Why should I care?" section mentioning The Changelog podcast.

## [0.0.2] - 2014-07-10

## [0.0.1] - 2014-05-31
### Added
- This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as an evolving example of a
  standardized open source project CHANGELOG.
- CNAME file to enable GitHub Pages custom domain
- README now contains answers to common questions about CHANGELOGs
- Good examples and basic guidelines, including proper date formatting.
- Counter-examples: "What makes unicorns cry?"
